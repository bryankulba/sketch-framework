# Sketch framework
The beginning of an initial sketch file page framework to help speed up design.

## Features
The pages (and design approach) are based on the [Atomic Design](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/) principles of Brad Frost. Beyond that, there is a structure that helps organize and break out pages for work spaces and inspiration.

## Structure and naming system for pages
The page naming system uses hyphens and underscores prefixes to identify different purposes for the page.

filename: primary page type, usually used for Atomic Design structure  
*filename: indicates page housing exportable assets or symbols, including things like website assets (favicon, etc). 
-filename: pages which act as iterative workspaces for specific blocks or elements. The intent of these pages is to keep the Atom, Molecule, Organism and Template pages as clear of unused iterations or versions of blocks and elements.   
_filename: indicates pages which house reference or inspirational material for specific blocks or elements   
--filename: any pages which have explorations, unused blocks, or junk which you don't want to delete
